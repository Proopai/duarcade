## Shiplib Shipengine

This just takes shiplib and physicslib out of shipos and makes it a standalone
control engine, to replace Navigator and axisCommand.

To use: Put shipengine.conf (from parent directory) into lua/autoconf/custom/.,
reload custom autoconfs, and apply "Ship Engine" custom autoconf.
